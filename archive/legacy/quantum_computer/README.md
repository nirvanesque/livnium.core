# Quantum Computer: Hierarchical Geometry System

## Concept: Geometry > Geometry in Geometry

A quantum computing system where geometric structures are nested hierarchically:
- **Level 0**: Base geometry (fundamental structure)
- **Level 1**: Geometry within geometry (nested structures)
- **Level 2**: Geometry within geometry within geometry (meta-structures)

Each level operates on the geometry of the level below it.

## Key Principle

**Geometry > Geometry in Geometry**

- Each level operates on the geometric structure of the level below
- Higher levels provide meta-geometric operations
- Creates hierarchical quantum state representation

## Features

- Hierarchical geometric representation
- Nested quantum states
- Meta-geometric operations
- Scalable architecture
