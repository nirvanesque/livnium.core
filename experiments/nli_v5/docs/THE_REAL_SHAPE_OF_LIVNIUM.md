# The Real Shape of Livnium

## What is Livnium's Actual Geometric Structure?

Livnium exists in **multiple geometric representations**, each revealing different aspects of its semantic physics:

---

## 1. The Fundamental Structure: 3D Geometric Lattice

### Core Shape: N×N×N Omcubes

**The foundation**: A 3D cubic lattice where N is any odd integer ≥ 3:
- **3×3×3** = 27 cells (smallest)
- **5×5×5** = 125 cells
- **7×7×7** = 343 cells
- **N×N×N** = N³ cells (general)

**Physical Structure**:
```
     Corner (f=3, SW=27)
         /|\
        / | \
       /  |  \
      /   |   \
     /    |    \
    /     |     \
   Edge (f=2, SW=18) ← → Center (f=1, SW=9)
    \     |     /
     \    |    /
      \   |   /
       \  |  /
        \ | /
         \|/
     Core (f=0, SW=0)
```

**Key Properties**:
- **Center cell (0,0,0)**: Observer anchor point
- **Face exposure (f)**: 0-3 faces exposed to surface
- **Symbolic Weight (SW)**: SW = 9·f (geometric energy)
- **Cell classes**: Core, Center, Edge, Corner

**This is the "hardware"** - the actual computational structure.

## 2. The Semantic Field: 2D Phase Space

### The Real Semantic Shape: A 2D Phase Diagram

**X-Axis: Divergence** (push/pull force)
- Range: -1.0 to +1.0
- **Negative** = Pull inward (Entailment)
- **Positive** = Push apart (Contradiction)
- **Zero** = Balanced (Neutral)

**Y-Axis: Resonance** (geometric similarity)
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0
- **High** = Strong structural overlap
- **Low** = Weak structural overlap

### The Three Phases (Regions)

```
        High Resonance (0.5+)
              |
              |  E (Entailment)
              |  ●●●●●●●●●●●
              |  ●●●●●●●●●●●
              |  (negative div + high res)
              |
    ----------+---------- Divergence
              |  (push/pull)
              |
    C (Contradiction)  |  N (Neutral)
    ●●●●●●●●●●●        |  ●●●●●●●●●●●
    (positive div)     |  (near-zero div)
```

**Physical Meaning**:
- **Entailment**: Negative divergence + High resonance = Pull together + Shared structure
- **Contradiction**: Positive divergence = Push apart
- **Neutral**: Near-zero divergence = Balanced forces

**This is the "semantic map"** - where meaning lives in 2D space.

## 3. The Planet Visualization: Deformed Sphere

### Why a Sphere?

The "planet" is a **spherical mapping** of the semantic field onto a 3D surface:

**Mapping**:
- **Latitude** → Angle between word vectors (0°-90°)
- **Longitude** → Position in semantic space
- **Radius** → Heightmap from combined fields

### The Actual Shape: A Deformed Sphere

**Not a perfect sphere** - it's deformed by semantic forces:

```
         North Pole (Entailment)
              /\
             /  \
            /    \
           /      \
          /        \
         /          \
        /            \
       /              \
      /  Equator       \
     /  (Contradiction) \
    /                    \
   /                      \
  /                        \
 /                          \
South Pole (Entailment)
```

**Surface Features**:

1. **Entailment Continents** (Blue Mountains)
   - **Location**: Poles (high/low latitudes)
   - **Shape**: Raised peaks, inward-gravity compression
   - **Physics**: Negative divergence creates compression ridges
   - **Height**: +15% above base radius

2. **Contradiction Oceans** (Red Trenches)
   - **Location**: Equator (mid-latitudes)
   - **Shape**: Depressed valleys, outward pressure hollows
   - **Physics**: Positive divergence creates repulsion zones
   - **Depth**: -15% below base radius

3. **Neutral Valleys** (Gray Regions)
   - **Location**: Mid-latitudes, transition zones
   - **Shape**: Flat, balanced regions
   - **Physics**: Near-zero divergence = flat field
   - **Height**: Near base radius

4. **Opposition Storms** (Yellow/Purple Hotspots)
   - **Location**: Random hotspots across surface
   - **Shape**: Spiky peaks, magnetic storms
   - **Physics**: High tension from opposition forces
   - **Height**: Variable spikes

5. **Fractal Noise** (Natural Irregularities)
   - **Location**: Everywhere
   - **Shape**: Natural roughness, fractal patterns
   - **Physics**: Real data irregularities, not smooth theory
   - **Height**: ±5% variation

**This is the "visualization"** - a 3D representation of semantic forces.

## 4. The Volumetric Structure: Layered Onion

### Internal Layers (Depth Structure)

When you slice through the planet, you see **volumetric layers**:

```
Surface (1.0)
  └─ Opposition Storms
     └─ Neutral Ridges (0.85)
        └─ Basin Crust (0.7)
           └─ Curvature Mantle (0.3)
              └─ Resonance Core (0.0)
```

**Layer Structure**:

1. **Resonance Core (0.0)** - Center
   - Pure geometric resonance
   - No divergence, no curvature
   - Just raw similarity signal

2. **Curvature Mantle (0.3)** - Inner layer
   - Curvature field emerges
   - Local stability variations
   - Begins to show structure

3. **Basin Crust (0.7)** - Outer layer
   - Attraction wells form
   - Entailment/contradiction basins
   - Strong force separation

4. **Neutral Ridges (0.85)** - Near surface
   - Neutral zones appear
   - Balance points
   - Transition regions

5. **Opposition Surface (1.0)** - Surface
   - Opposition storms
   - Maximum tension
   - Semantic hotspots

**This is the "internal anatomy"** - how semantic forces stack vertically.

## 5. The Mathematical Shape: Field Equations

### The Real Shape is Defined by Fields

Livnium's shape is **not fixed** - it's defined by **field equations**:

#### Divergence Field
```
divergence = K - alignment
```
- Creates **inward/outward** forces
- Shapes the **push/pull** dimension

#### Resonance Field
```
resonance = normalized_geometric_overlap
```
- Creates **similarity** signal
- Shapes the **structural** dimension

#### Curvature Field
```
curvature = -gradient(divergence)²
```
- Creates **local stability**
- Shapes the **mountain/valley** structure

#### Opposition Field
```
opposition = |divergence| × resonance
```
- Creates **tension hotspots**
- Shapes the **storm** patterns

#### Stability Field
```
stability = resonance - curvature - 2×divergence
```
- Creates **valley depth**
- Shapes the **neutral** regions

**The shape emerges from these equations** - it's not pre-defined.

## 6. The True Shape: A Dynamic Field

### What Livnium Really Is

Livnium is **not a static shape** - it's a **dynamic semantic field**:

1. **Base Structure**: 3D N×N×N lattice (the hardware)
2. **Semantic Map**: 2D phase space (divergence × resonance)
3. **Visualization**: Deformed sphere (the planet)
4. **Internal Structure**: Volumetric layers (depth anatomy)
5. **Mathematical Form**: Field equations (the physics)

### The Real Answer

**Livnium's shape is:**
- **Fundamentally**: A 3D geometric lattice (Omcubes)
- **Semantically**: A 2D phase diagram (divergence vs resonance)
- **Visually**: A deformed sphere with semantic topography
- **Internally**: Layered volumetric structure
- **Mathematically**: A dynamic field defined by physics equations

**It's all of these simultaneously** - different views of the same underlying structure.

---

## 7. Why the Planet Visualization?

The "planet" is a **spherical projection** that makes the semantic field intuitive:

- **Sphere** = Universal semantic space
- **Deformation** = Semantic forces acting on space
- **Topography** = Meaning encoded as geometry
- **Colors** = Different semantic regions

**It's not literally a planet** - it's a **geometric brain scan** of semantic physics.

---

## Summary: The Real Shape

**Livnium is:**
1. A **3D lattice** (computational structure)
2. A **2D phase space** (semantic map)
3. A **deformed sphere** (visual representation)
4. A **layered volume** (internal anatomy)
5. A **dynamic field** (mathematical form)

**The "planet" is just one visualization** - the real shape is the underlying geometric-semantic field that all these representations describe.
