# Livnium NLI v7: Geometry Shaping

## The Core Principle

**"I already have a shape for meaning. Now let me use it."**

Train ONLY geometry, never Layer 4.

## Key Innovation

**Physics Reinforcement**: Small, continuous energy updates to shape the manifold.

- **Entailment** → deepen inward basin
- **Contradiction** → amplify outward push  
- **Neutral** → enforce equilibrium

## Architecture

**Layers 0-3**: Geometry layers (WITH learning)
- Update thresholds
- Deepen basins
- Amplify forces
- Shape the manifold

**Layer 4**: Decision (PASSIVE)
- No learning
- Only observes
- Pure physics-based rules

## Status

⚠️ **Design Phase** - See `DESIGN.md` for details

## Next Steps

1. Implement physics reinforcement in Layers 0-3
2. Make Layer 4 passive (no learning)
3. Test manifold shaping
4. Compare with v6 baseline
