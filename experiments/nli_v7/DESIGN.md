# Livnium NLI v7: Geometry Shaping (Not Classifier Tuning)

## The Core Insight

**"I already have a shape for meaning. Now let me use it."**

The geometry distinguishes E/C/N, but not strongly enough. We need to **stabilize the three axes** and **deepen the bowl**.

## The Seven Steps

### 1. Fix the Bowl Shape (The Manifold)

**Goal**: Make the bowl deeper for E/C and the ridge sharper for N.

**Three axes to stabilize**:
- Axis 1: **Resonance** (energy / closeness)
- Axis 2: **Divergence sign** (push vs pull)
- Axis 3: **Cold vs Far attraction** (semantic geography)

### 2. Train ONLY Geometry — Never Layer 4

**Layer 4 becomes passive**:
- No learning
- No tuning
- Only observes geometry

**Tune geometry instead**:
- Divergence threshold
- Cold density formula
- Far force decay
- Resonance scaling
- Curvature smoothing

### 3. Physics Reinforcement (Energy Tuning)

When an example is correct:
- **Entailment** → deepen the inward basin
- **Contradiction** → amplify outward push
- **Neutral** → enforce equilibrium (0)

**NOT gradient descent** - this is **energy tuning**.

Small, continuous updates to the field per sample.

### 4. Entropy Heat (Thermal Noise)

Add small random perturbations:
- Let geometry "shake" and settle
- Remove noise when pattern stabilizes

**Entropy allows discovery. Cooling locks meaning.**

### 5. Pure Geometry Space

Remove English words entirely:
- Geometry operates on pure resonance vectors
- Lexicon layer ONLY maps text → geometry
- Everything else works in physics space

### 6. Emergent Rule Capture

Let the system build its OWN rules:
- Track which geometric combinations appear often
- Mark them as "stable laws"
- Feed them back into the manifold
- These become Livnium's axioms of meaning

### 7. Confirm Manifold Robustness

Test on:
- Wrong labels (shouldn't break it)
- Random labels (shouldn't break it)
- Inverted labels (shouldn't break it)
- Shuffled words (shouldn't break it)

## Implementation Priority

**Start with Physics Reinforcement** - most concrete and will directly improve manifold shape.

## Architecture

**Layer 0-3**: Geometry layers (WITH learning)
- Update thresholds
- Deepen basins
- Amplify forces
- Shape the manifold

**Layer 4**: Decision (PASSIVE)
- No learning
- Only observes
- Pure physics-based rules

## Status

⚠️ **Design Phase** - Ready for implementation
