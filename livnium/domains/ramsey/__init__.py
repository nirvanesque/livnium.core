Ramsey Domain: Ramsey Number Constraint Satisfaction

Ramsey domain implementation for graph coloring constraint satisfaction.
Uses kernel.physics for all physics calculations.
Uses engine.collapse for dynamics.

The ramsey domain encodes graph edge colorings into state vectors and
checks for constraint satisfaction (no monochromatic cliques).
