"""
Market Domain: Financial Market Regime Classification

Market domain implementation for financial time series analysis.
Uses kernel.physics for all physics calculations.
Uses engine.collapse for dynamics.

The market domain encodes financial time series data (OHLCV) into state vectors
and classifies market regimes (Bull/Bear/Neutral/Panic/Euphoria) using
geometric alignment and tension calculations.
