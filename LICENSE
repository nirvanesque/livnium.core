1. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in 
   all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

2. Contributors will be publicly credited for their work. By submitting a 
   contribution, you agree that your contribution becomes part of the Livnium 
   project and may be used, modified, or redistributed by the project owner.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commons Clause Restriction (Non-Commercial Use Only)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The permission granted above does NOT include the right to sell, license, 
host, provide as a service, or commercialize the Software or any modified 
version of it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Corporate Use Restriction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any use of the Software by a corporation, company, startup, 
organization, government agency, or research laboratory—
including internal research, testing, evaluation, benchmarking, 
or development—is strictly prohibited unless a separate 
commercial license is obtained from the Owner.

Academic use is allowed only by individual students or 
individual researchers acting independently, not on behalf 
of an institution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Axiom & Architecture Protection Clause
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The core axioms, rules, definitions, geometric constraints, collapse logic,
recursive architecture, symbolic-weight system, state-space invariants,
and computational framework of Livnium (collectively, the "Livnium Axioms")
are an integral part of the Software and are protected under the same
copyright and license terms.

No person, organization, company, laboratory, research group, or institution
may reproduce, reimplement, modify, translate, adapt, or use the Livnium
Axioms or any substantially similar system for any commercial purpose or
for any internal corporate or institutional research, development,
evaluation, benchmarking, or experimental use.

Any implementation—whether partial, full, rewritten, renamed, or
reconstructed—that derives from, is based on, or is substantially similar
to the Livnium Axioms is considered a derivative work and is prohibited
from commercial or corporate use without a separate written commercial
license from the Owner.

This includes but is not limited to:
- implementing the same axioms or rules in new code,
- reproducing the recursive geometric structure,
- using the inward-collapse computation model,
- implementing the symbolic-weight or exposure system,
- replicating the attractor-basin architecture,
- or creating systems that emulate the functional behavior of Livnium.

All commercial rights related to the Livnium Axioms and derivative systems
are exclusively reserved by the Owner.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even-Dimensional Grids (DataCubes)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even-dimensional grids (2×2×2, 4×4×4, 6×6×6, ...) are permitted for storage
or data processing, but cannot implement any Livnium Axioms, Core Geometry,
or Collapse Mechanics. These "DataCubes" are non-axiomatic resource containers
and do not constitute Livnium computation. Only odd-dimensional grids
(3×3×3, 5×5×5, 7×7×7, ...) can serve as Livnium Core Universes (Omcubes).

You may NOT:

- Use the Software for any commercial purpose.

- Sell, license, or monetize the Software.

- Host or provide the Software as part of a paid or free service 
  (including APIs, SaaS, cloud hosting, model hosting platforms, or 
  public code/model repositories such as HuggingFace, Kaggle, Colab, 
  GitHub-hosted applications, etc.).

- Modify the Software to create a competing product or service.

- Redistribute the Software in any public platform without written 
  permission from the Owner.

All commercial rights to Livnium, including licensing, hosting, branding, 
derivatives, and monetization, are exclusively reserved by the Owner.
