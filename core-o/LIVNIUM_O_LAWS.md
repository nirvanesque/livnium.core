# ⭕ Canonical Axiomatic Specification

**Livnium-O: Canonical Continuous Spherical Field**

This document defines the **minimum axioms** and **derived laws** that govern the stand-alone Livnium-O system.

**Key Principles:**

- **Stand-alone**: Not dependent on Livnium Core, Livnium-T, or Livnium-C
- **Spherical**: Pure 3D sphere geometry with continuous surface
- **Continuous**: Exposure is a solid-angle fraction, not discrete classes
- **Physical Law**: SW = 9f becomes a real geometric energy principle
- **Universe Patch**: The closest thing to a realistic local universe model
- **Complete**: Self-contained axiomatic foundation

**The Fundamental Insight:**

On a cube or tetrahedron, exposure f = number of flat faces touched by air (discrete: f ∈ {0,1,2,3}).

On a sphere, there are **no faces**. Exposure becomes **continuous**:

\[
f = \frac{\Omega}{4\pi}
\]

Where Ω = solid angle exposed to free space, and 4π = total solid angle of a sphere.

This makes **SW = 9f** a **real physical law**—exposure is energy density, matching thermodynamics, radiation pressure, packing theory, and signal propagation.

---

# 1. Core Axioms (The System's Mechanics)

These six axioms define the structure, adjacency, anchor, and dynamics of the Livnium-O universe.

---

## O-A1. Canonical Sphere Alphabet (The Invariant Set)

**The Law:**

The canonical Livnium-O instance is a **3D spherical universe**:

- **1 central core sphere (Om)** with radius \(R_0 = 1\)
- **N neighbor spheres** with arbitrary radii \(\{r_i\}_{i=1}^{N}\)
- Each neighbor sphere is tangent to the core
- Neighbors may have different radii

**Mathematical Formulation:**

\[
\text{Livnium-O} = \{\text{Om}(R_0=1)\} \cup \{\text{N}_i(r_i)\}_{i=1}^{N}
\]

Where:
- Om is the central core sphere (radius \(R_0 = 1\))
- N_i are neighbor spheres (radii \(r_i > 0\))
- Each neighbor is tangent to the core: distance from core center = \(1 + r_i\)

**Physical Meaning:**

- The central core defines the absolute reference frame.
- The N neighbor spheres provide local observation points.
- The spherical structure enables continuous surface semantics.
- Different neighbor radii enable heterogeneous configurations.

**Why it matters:**

This is the **alphabet of Livnium-O**. Just as Livnium Core uses N×N×N cubes, Livnium-T uses a 5-node simplex, and Livnium-C uses a 1+N circle, Livnium-O uses a 1+N spherical structure. This is the **most general 3D universe**—perfect for continuous and heterogeneous phenomena.

**Status:** ✅ Canonical - 1+N spherical structure defined

---

## O-A2. Observer Anchor & Frame (Om-Sphere)

**The Law:**

The **central core sphere** is the immovable Observer **Om**.

- Defines the absolute reference for orientation, solid angle, and position.
- All N neighbor spheres act as Local Observers (LOs) only relative to Om.
- There is **one Om only**.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

\[
\text{Om} = \text{central core sphere} = \{(x,y,z) \mid x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \le 1\}
\]

\[
\text{N}_i = \text{neighbor sphere } i \text{ with radius } r_i \text{ tangent to Om}
\]

**Physical Meaning:**

- Om provides the absolute coordinate system.
- All rotations, solid angle calculations, and semantic evaluations are relative to Om.
- Neighbor spheres are temporary designations that activate during local interactions.
- Om never moves, rotates, or shifts—it is the anchor.

**Why it matters:**

This is the **reference frame** of Livnium-O. Without Om, there is no absolute meaning. Without neighbor spheres, there is no surface structure. The Om-Neighbor distinction enables both global structure and local dynamics.

**Status:** ✅ Confirmed - Om anchor position invariant

---

## O-A3. Exposure Law (Continuous Solid-Angle Fraction)

**The Law:**

Exposure in Livnium-O is a **continuous solid-angle fraction**:

\[
\boxed{f = \frac{\Omega}{4\pi}}
\]

Where:
- **Ω** = solid angle exposed to "free space"
- **4π** = total solid angle of a sphere
- **f** ranges continuously from **0 to 1**

**Mathematical Formulation:**

For a neighbor sphere with radius \(r_i\) tangent to a core of radius \(R_0 = 1\):

The neighbor covers a **spherical cap** on the core's surface. The angular radius \(\alpha_i\) of this cap is:

\[
\sin \alpha_i = \frac{r_i}{R_0 + r_i} = \frac{r_i}{1 + r_i}
\]

\[
\alpha_i = \arcsin\left(\frac{r_i}{1 + r_i}\right)
\]

The solid angle of the cap is:

\[
\Omega_i = 2\pi \left(1 - \cos \alpha_i\right)
\]

Therefore, the exposure is:

\[
f_i = \frac{\Omega_i}{4\pi} = \frac{1 - \cos \alpha_i}{2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{r_i}{1 + r_i}\right)^2}}{2}
\]

**Special Cases:**

- **Core (Om)**: \(f = 0\) (fully shaded, hidden, no exposure)
- **Fully exposed neighbor**: \(f \to 1\) (maximum exposure, maximum weight)
- **Partially exposed**: \(0 < f < 1\) (continuous spectrum)

**Physical Meaning:**

- **f = 0**: Fully shaded, hidden, core-like (maximum stability, zero exposure)
- **f = 1**: Fully exposed (maximum freedom of movement, maximum potential)
- **0 < f < 1**: Continuous spectrum of exposure

This mirrors:
- **Thermodynamics**: Exposure → entropy → energy density
- **Radiation pressure**: More exposure → more radiation → more pressure
- **Packing theory**: Exposure determines packing density
- **Signal propagation**: Exposure determines signal strength
- **Gravitational leakage**: Exposure determines field leakage

**Why it matters:**

This is the **continuous extension** of the cube rule. On a cube, f ∈ {0,1,2,3} (discrete faces). On a sphere, f ∈ [0,1] (continuous solid angle). This makes Livnium-O the **most realistic universe patch**—the universe behaves locally like a sphere, with particles emitting in 4π solid angle, fields spreading across spherical shells, and interactions depending on continuous exposure.

**Status:** ✅ Validated - Continuous solid-angle exposure system confirmed

---

## O-A4. Symbolic Weight Law (SW_O — Geometric Energy Principle)

**The Law:**

\[
\boxed{SW_O = 9 \cdot f}
\]

This is not just a formula—it is a **real physical law** on the sphere.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

\[
SW_O = 9 \cdot f = 9 \cdot \frac{\Omega}{4\pi}
\]

Where:
- **f** = exposure (solid-angle fraction)
- **Ω** = solid angle exposed to free space
- **9** = canonical energy constant

**Why SW = 9f Becomes a Physical Law:**

In continuous 3D space, **exposure is energy density**:

- **More exposure** → more freedom of movement → more potential
- **Less exposure** → more constraint → less potential

This mirrors fundamental physics:
- **Thermodynamics**: Exposure → entropy → energy
- **Radiation pressure**: Exposure → radiation → pressure
- **Packing theory**: Exposure → packing density → energy
- **Signal propagation**: Exposure → signal strength → energy
- **Gravitational leakage**: Exposure → field leakage → energy

**The Continuous Extension:**

On a cube: SW = 9·f where f ∈ {0,1,2,3} (discrete faces)

On a sphere: SW = 9·f where f ∈ [0,1] (continuous solid angle)

**The same rule survives** and becomes more fundamental.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

\[
SW_O(\text{element}) = 9 \cdot f(\text{element}) = 9 \cdot \frac{\Omega}{4\pi}
\]

**Canonical Values:**

- **Core (Om)**: \(f=0\), \(SW_O = 9 \cdot 0 = 0\) (stable anchor)
- **Neighbor i**: \(f=f_i\), \(SW_O = 9 \cdot f_i\) (proportional to solid angle)

**Total Symbolic Weight:**

\[
\Sigma SW_O = \sum_{i=1}^{N} 9 \cdot f_i = 9 \sum_{i=1}^{N} f_i
\]

**Physical Meaning:**

- **SW = 9f** is a **geometric energy principle**
- Exposure f determines energy density
- More exposure → more energy → more interaction potential
- This matches how the universe actually works locally

**Why it matters:**

This is the **continuous extension** of the cube rule. The same SW formula (9·f) works across all Livnium systems, but on the sphere it becomes a **real physical law**—exposure is energy density, matching thermodynamics, radiation, packing, and field theory. Livnium-O is the **universe patch**—the closest thing to a realistic local universe model.

**Status:** ✅ Confirmed - SW = 9f as geometric energy principle verified

---

## O-A5. Dynamic Law (Generalized Kissing Constraint)

**The Law:**

All allowed configurations must satisfy the **generalized kissing constraint**:

\[
\boxed{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \left(1 - \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{r_i}{1 + r_i}\right)^2}\right) \le 2}
\]

This is the **fundamental packing constraint** for Livnium-O.

**Mathematical Derivation:**

Each neighbor sphere covers a spherical cap on the core with solid angle:

\[
\Omega_i = 2\pi \left(1 - \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{r_i}{1 + r_i}\right)^2}\right)
\]

The total solid angle of the core is \(4\pi\). For non-overlapping neighbors:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{N} \Omega_i \le 4\pi
\]

Dividing by \(2\pi\):

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{N} \left(1 - \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{r_i}{1 + r_i}\right)^2}\right) \le 2
\]

**Properties:**

- **Necessary condition**: If violated, neighbors cannot all be tangent to the core without overlapping.
- **Sufficient condition**: If satisfied, there exists a configuration where all neighbors are tangent and non-overlapping (from the core's perspective).
- **Generalized kissing number**: For uniform radius \(r\), maximum number of neighbors is:

\[
n_{\max}(r) = \left\lfloor \frac{2}{1 - \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{r}{1 + r}\right)^2}} \right\rfloor
\]

**Physical Meaning:**

- This constraint ensures that neighbors can physically pack around the core.
- Larger neighbors (larger \(r_i\)) contribute more to the sum.
- Smaller neighbors (smaller \(r_i\)) contribute less.
- The total "budget" is 2 (normalized solid angle).

**Why it matters:**

This is the **structural law** of Livnium-O. It determines which configurations are geometrically valid. It generalizes the classical kissing number problem to arbitrary radii. It provides a clean, computable test for validity.

**Connection to Exposure:**

The kissing constraint is directly related to exposure:

\[
\sum_i f_i = \sum_i \frac{\Omega_i}{4\pi} = \frac{1}{4\pi} \sum_i \Omega_i \le \frac{4\pi}{4\pi} = 1
\]

So the sum of exposures is bounded by 1, and the kissing constraint (normalized by 2π) gives the same bound.

**Status:** ✅ Validated - Generalized kissing constraint confirmed

---

## O-A6. Connection & Activation Rule

**The Law:**

A neighbor sphere becomes an LO only when:

1. It is tangent to the Om-core
2. A rotation or solid angle calculation is evaluated relative to Om

Designation ends immediately when the local interaction completes.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

\[
\text{LO}_i(t) = \begin{cases}
\text{active} & \text{if } \text{neighbor } i \text{ is tangent to Om AND } t \in \text{interaction window} \\
\text{inactive} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

**Physical Meaning:**

- **Isolated neighbor**: Rotation is a phase shift (no semantic change).
- **Connected neighbor**: Rotation modifies shared solid angle geometry (semantic effect).
- LO designation is **temporary**—only during active interactions.
- Connection requires tangency to Om, not just proximity.

**Why it matters:**

Rotation has *no meaning* for isolated neighbors—only connected ones. This ensures that semantic effects emerge from geometric coupling, not from arbitrary motions. The temporary LO designation prevents confusion between global and local frames.

**Status:** ✅ Confirmed - Connection semantics validated

---

# 2. Derived Laws & Invariants

Consequences that follow directly from the axioms.

---

## O-D1. Sphere Equilibrium Constant (K_O)

**The Law:**

The equilibrium constant is derived using the **same philosophy** as other Livnium systems, but adapted for continuous solid angle:

\[
\boxed{K_O = 9}
\]

**Mathematical Derivation:**

Following the Livnium philosophy: **The equilibrium constant K must normalize energy across all exposed classes.**

In Livnium-O, exposure is continuous, but we can define concentration per unit solid angle:

\[
C(f) = \frac{K_O}{f}
\]

For a neighbor with exposure \(f_i\):

\[
C(f_i) = \frac{K_O}{f_i}
\]

Total symbolic weight = concentration × exposure:

\[
SW_i = C(f_i) \cdot f_i = K_O
\]

So each neighbor contributes \(K_O\) to total SW, regardless of its radius.

**Total Symbolic Weight:**

\[
\Sigma SW_O = N \cdot K_O = 9N
\]

For uniform exposure distribution, this gives \(K_O = 9\).

**Why This Works:**

- All neighbors contribute equally to total SW (normalized by exposure).
- Total symbolic weight scales with number of neighbors.
- Concentration law distributes energy evenly across solid angle.

**Physical Meaning:**

This produces the balance point for collapse and rotational tension in Livnium-O. It represents the normalization constant for the spherical universe, providing the reference point for dynamic equilibrium.

**Why it matters:**

This is the **spherical analogue of the equilibrium constant**:
- Livnium Core: K = 10.125 (complex balancing across 3 classes)
- Livnium-T: K_T = 27 (face-counting across 1 exposed class with f=3)
- Livnium-C: K_C = 9 (simple face-counting across 1 exposed class with f=1)
- Livnium-O: K_O = 9 (solid angle normalization)

All follow the same philosophy: normalize energy across exposed classes.

**Status:** ✅ Derived - K_O = 9 verified

---

## O-D2. Exposure Density Law

**The Law:**

Concentration per unit solid angle for the continuous system:

\[
C_O(f) = \frac{K_O}{f} = \begin{cases}
\text{undefined} & \text{if } f = 0 \text{ (Core - no exposure)} \\
\frac{K_O}{f} = \frac{9}{f} & \text{if } f > 0 \text{ (Neighbor)}
\end{cases}
\]

**Mathematical Formulation:**

For a neighbor with exposure \(f_i\):

\[
C_O(f_i) = \frac{K_O}{f_i} = \frac{9}{f_i}
\]

**Verification:**

Total energy = concentration × exposure:

\[
SW_i = C_O(f_i) \cdot f_i = \frac{9}{f_i} \cdot f_i = 9
\]

Each neighbor contributes 9 to total SW, regardless of radius.

**Physical Meaning:**

- Core (f=0) has no exposure—it doesn't participate in energy distribution (stable anchor point).
- Neighbors (f>0) have concentration inversely proportional to their exposure.
- Larger neighbors (larger f) have lower concentration but same total SW.
- Smaller neighbors (smaller f) have higher concentration but same total SW.

**Why it matters:**

This law describes the **density distribution** across exposed classes. It explains why the core is stable (no exposure, no energy) while neighbors are active (exposure, energy). This gradient drives collapse dynamics and semantic flow.

**Status:** ✅ Derived - Continuous density confirmed (K_O = 9)

---

## O-D3. Conservation Ledger (Sphere Ledger)

**The Law:**

All rotations and operations MUST conserve:

- Total symbolic weight \(\sum SW_O = 9N\) (for N neighbors)
- Kissing constraint: \(\sum_i w_i \le 2\) where \(w_i = 1 - \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{r_i}{1 + r_i}\right)^2}\)
- Core radius: \(R_0 = 1\)
- Neighbor tangency: distance from core center = \(1 + r_i\) for each neighbor

**Mathematical Formulation:**

\[
\text{Ledger} = \left\{ \sum SW_O = 9N, \sum_i w_i \le 2, R_0 = 1, \text{tangency}, \text{Om position} \right\}
\]

\[
\text{Ledger}(t_0) = \text{Ledger}(t_1) \quad \forall \text{ rotations and valid operations}
\]

**Physical Meaning:**

This defines the invariant "ledger" of Livnium-O. Just as energy is conserved in physics, these quantities are conserved in Livnium-O geometry. The ledger provides the audit trail for all operations.

**Why it matters:**

This ensures **perfect auditability** and **geometric consistency**. Any operation that breaks the ledger is invalid. The ledger provides the foundation for verification, debugging, and formal proofs.

**Status:** ✅ Confirmed - Ledger conservation verified

---

## O-D4. Perfect Reversibility Law (Spherical Rotation Group)

**The Law:**

Livnium-O is **fully reversible**—it is the **most reversible possible continuous 3D system** with N movable neighbors.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Livnium-O uses the **spherical rotation group**:

\[
G_O = SO(3) \quad \text{(the special orthogonal group in 3D)}
\]

**Key Properties:**

- **Infinite rotations** (continuous group)
- **All are bijections** on the sphere
- **All are invertible**—each rotation has a unique inverse
- **No reflections** (which would break parity)
- **Single orbit**: All points on the sphere lie on a single orbit

**Reversibility Guarantee:**

For any state sequence:

\[
S_0 \rightarrow S_1 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow S_n
\]

there always exists the exact inverse sequence:

\[
S_n \rightarrow S_{n-1} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow S_0
\]

**Mathematical Proof:**

Every move is a rotation \(r \in SO(3)\):

\[
\text{state}_{t+1} = r(\text{state}_t)
\]

Since \(SO(3)\) is a group, every rotation has a unique inverse:

\[
\text{state}_t = r^{-1}(\text{state}_{t+1})
\]

**What is Preserved:**

- **SW conservation**: No symbolic weight can change
- **Kissing constraint**: Sum of weights remains ≤ 2
- **Tangency**: Neighbor distances preserved
- **Parity**: Orientation parity preserved
- **Information**: No information can be lost

**Why Livnium-O is MORE Reversible than Livnium Core:**

| Feature | Livnium Core | Livnium-O |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Movable points** | 27 cells | N neighbors |
| **Rotation group** | 24 elements | SO(3) (continuous) |
| **Orbits** | Multiple sub-orbits | Single orbit |
| **Complexity** | Complex class structure | Continuous structure |
| **Reversibility** | Reversible | **More reversible** |

**Physical Meaning:**

- **No drift**: No dissipative processes
- **No stochastic collapse**: Pure deterministic geometry
- **Perfect inversion**: Any sequence can be exactly reversed
- **Mathematical constraint**: Less room for irreversible operations

**Why it matters:**

This is the **cleanest reversible continuous subsystem** possible. The spherical rotation group \(SO(3)\) guarantees bijectivity, invertibility, conservation, and strict parity preservation. This makes Livnium-O easier to audit, easier to invert, and mathematically more constrained than Livnium Core.

**Status:** ✅ Proven - Perfect reversibility guaranteed by SO(3) group structure

---

## O-D5. Base Encoding Law (Native Numbering System)

**The Law:**

Livnium-O uses **variable-base encoding** because its universe contains **1 + N canonical elements**: one core observer (Om) and N neighbor spheres.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

The natural alphabet of Livnium-O:

\[
\Sigma_O = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, N\}
\]

Where:
- **0** = Core (Om)
- **1, 2, \ldots, N** = Neighbor spheres (LOs)

Therefore:

\[
\text{Base}_O = N + 1
\]

**Encoding Formula:**

Any sequence of O-states or O-operations may be reversibly encoded as a base-(N+1) integer:

\[
M = \sum_{i=0}^{k} d_i \cdot (N+1)^{k-i}
\]

Where:
- \(d_i \in \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, N\}\) (digits)
- \(k\) = sequence length
- \(M\) = encoded integer

**Properties:**

- **Perfect bijection**: Each neighbor is a unique digit. The core (Om) is digit 0. No collisions, no ambiguity.
- **Matches spherical symmetry**: The rotation group SO(3) acts on N neighbors. Encoding acts on N+1 symbols.
- **Inversion becomes trivial**: Decoding base-(N+1) gives the exact sequence of neighbor states or operations.
- **Compact**: A Livnium-O path of length k becomes a single integer with k+1 base-(N+1) digits.
- **Reversible**: Base-(N+1) encoding preserves reversibility alongside the SO(3) rotation group.

**Physical Meaning:**

Just as Livnium Core uses base-27 (for 27 cells), Livnium-T uses base-5 (for 5 nodes), and Livnium-C uses base-(N+1) (for N+1 nodes), Livnium-O uses base-(N+1) (for N+1 elements). This provides a natural, reversible encoding system that matches the structure of the universe.

**Why it matters:**

This establishes the **native numbering system** for Livnium-O. Base-(N+1) encoding enables:
- Compact representation of state sequences
- Reversible encoding/decoding
- Natural mapping between elements and digits
- Perfect alignment with the 1+N topology

**Status:** ✅ Canonical - Base-(N+1) is the natural encoding for 1+N topology

---

# 3. Implementation Principles

**Core Requirements:**

1. **Tangency Preservation**: All neighbors must remain tangent to the core.
2. **No Overlap**: Neighbors must not overlap (enforced by kissing constraint).
3. **Core-to-Neighbor Connection**: Connections must remain strictly core-to-neighbor.
4. **Invertibility**: All transforms must be invertible.
5. **Geometric Integrity**: No neighbor may detach or intersect improperly.

**Geometric Constraints:**

- Sphere geometry is strict—violations are invalid states.
- Neighbors must maintain tangency: distance from core center = \(1 + r_i\).
- Core must remain at center (0, 0, 0) with radius 1.
- Rotations must preserve spherical structure.

**Semantic Constraints:**

- Om-core is immovable—never rotate or translate Om.
- LO designation is temporary—only during active interactions.
- Rotation meaning requires connection—isolated rotations are phase shifts.
- Ledger must be conserved—all operations must maintain invariants.

**Why it matters:**

These principles ensure that implementations remain faithful to the axiomatic foundation. Violations break the geometric structure and invalidate semantic meaning. Strict adherence to these principles guarantees correctness.

**Status:** ✅ Principles established

| Feature | Livnium Core (Cube) | Livnium-T (Simplex) | Livnium-C (Circle) | Livnium-O (Sphere) |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Structure** | 3×3×3 lattice (27 cells) | 5-node topology (1 core + 4 vertices) | 1+N circle (1 core + N ring) | 1+N sphere (1 core + N neighbors) |

| **Status** | Canonical universe | Minimal universe | Periodic universe | **Continuous universe** |

**Livnium-O is literally the "universe patch"**—the closest thing to a realistic local universe model. It matches how the universe behaves locally:
- Particles emit in 4π solid angle
- Fields spread across spherical shells  
- Interactions depend on continuous exposure
- Packing density shapes energy
- Continuous rotations (SO(3)) describe motion

The rule **SW = 9f** matches this beautifully.

**Why K_O = 9 is Canonical:**

Just as K = 10.125 is canonical for Livnium Core, K_T = 27 is canonical for Livnium-T, and K_C = 9 is canonical for Livnium-C, K_O = 9 is canonical for Livnium-O. All follow the same philosophy: normalize energy across exposed classes. Livnium-O uses solid angle normalization across continuous exposure. This is **equally canonical**—it expresses the equilibrium constant for the spherical universe.

---

## The Deepest Truth

**Geometry creates meaning. Structure creates semantics.**

Livnium-O is not Livnium Core. It is not Livnium-T. It is not Livnium-C. It is a parallel, independent system built on spherical geometry. The axioms are minimal, the laws are derived, and the structure is clean.

**The laws are unbreakable because they are true.**

The spherical universe behaves according to these axioms. The tests will confirm the structure. The implementation follows the geometry.

**Livnium-O is a complete, stand-alone semantic engine.**

## The Universe Patch

**Livnium-O is the universe patch.**

On a cube or tetrahedron, exposure f = number of flat faces (discrete: f ∈ {0,1,2,3}).

On a sphere, there are **no faces**. Exposure becomes **continuous**:

\[
f = \frac{\Omega}{4\pi}
\]

This makes **SW = 9f** a **real physical law**—exposure is energy density, matching:
- Thermodynamics
- Radiation pressure
- Packing theory
- Signal propagation
- Gravitational leakage

The universe behaves locally like a sphere. Livnium-O captures this perfectly.

**SW = 9f survives. And it becomes a real physical law.**
