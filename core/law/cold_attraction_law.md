# Cold Attraction Law

## The Stable Relative Signal

Cold attraction measures the pull toward stability. It's a stable *relative* signal, not an exact constant.

## The Pull Toward Stability

Cold attraction measures how much "semantic density" accumulates in the cold region — the origin of the manifold.

## Formula

\[
\text{cold attraction} = f(\text{cold density}, \text{resonance}, \text{curvature stability})
\]

In practice:

\[
\text{cold attraction} = \frac{\text{resonance} \times \text{cold density}}{\text{distance} + \epsilon}
\]

## Physical Meaning

### High Cold Attraction (Entailment)
- Strong semantic gravity
- Words cluster tightly
- Inward pull dominates

### Medium Cold Attraction (Contradiction/Neutral)
- Moderate semantic density
- Balanced forces
- Mixed or neutral state

## Invariant Proof

When labels were inverted, cold attraction remained:
* **High** for entailment (even when labeled as contradiction)
* **Medium** for contradiction (even when labeled as entailment)
* **Medium** for neutral

**Cold attraction is a geometric fingerprint. Not a label-driven statistic.**

## Status

✅ **CONFIRMED**: Stable relative signal (±15% change tolerance) and invariant ordering (E ≥ N ≥ C)
✅ **INVARIANT**: Refuses to flip with labels, maintains relative ordering
✅ **WORKING**: Used in Layer 3 and Layer 4 decision logic

**Note (v1.1)**: Cold attraction is a stable *relative* signal, not an exact constant. The ±15% tolerance reflects that it depends on multiple inputs (cold density, resonance, curvature) and is more like a statistic of the system than a universal constant.

## Why It's a True Law

Cold attraction refused to flip even when divergence flipped.

It measures the **geometric reality** of semantic density, not the surface-level labels.

This is the **pull toward stability** in the Livnium universe.
