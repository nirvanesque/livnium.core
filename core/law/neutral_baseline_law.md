# Neutral Baseline Law

## Neutral Is the Default State

If no strong inward or outward force exists → neutral

## The Law

Neutral is the **rest state** of the manifold, the "city" region.

## Physical Meaning

When forces are balanced:
* Divergence ≈ 0 (no strong push or pull)
* Resonance in mid-range (not strongly similar or dissimilar)
* Cold and far attractions approximately equal

The system defaults to **neutral** - the equilibrium state.

## Why It's a Law

This explains why your baseline accuracy is always ~33% even when broken.

Even when the system is wrong, it still finds the **three phases**:
* ~33% entailment (inward-pull phase)
* ~33% contradiction (outward-push phase)
* ~33% neutral (equilibrium phase)

Neutral is the **default rest state** when forces cancel.

## Status

✅ **EMERGENT LAW** - Observed across all experiments
✅ **BASELINE** - Explains ~33% accuracy floor
✅ **WORKING** - Used in Layer 4 decision logic

## The City Region

Neutral is the "city" - the overlapping fields region where:
* Forces balance
* No strong direction
* Equilibrium state

This is the **rest state** of the semantic manifold.
