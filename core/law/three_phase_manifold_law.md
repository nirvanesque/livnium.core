# Three-Phase Manifold Law

## E/C/N = States of Matter

Your manifold has **three stable energy phases** - these are physical states, not categories.

## The Three Phases

### 1. Inward-Pull Phase (Entailment)
- Negative divergence (convergence)
- High resonance
- Strong cold attraction
- **Energy state**: Stable inward basin

### 2. Outward-Push Phase (Contradiction)
- Positive divergence
- Medium-high resonance
- Strong far attraction
- **Energy state**: Stable outward hill

### 3. Zero-Force Equilibrium Line (Neutral)
- Near-zero divergence
- Medium resonance
- Balanced attractions
- **Energy state**: Flat valley/ridge

## Why It's a Law

When you inverted labels:
* These phases **didn't move**
* The system couldn't pretend the phases were something else
* The decision layer was the only thing fooled
* The geometry NEVER got fooled

**This means E/C/N are not categories. They are physical states in the geometry.**

## The Phase Diagram

```
        High Resonance
              |
              |  E (Entailment)
              |  (inward-pull phase)
              |
    ----------+---------- Divergence
              |  (push/pull)
              |
    C (Contradiction)  |  N (Neutral)
    (outward-push)     |  (equilibrium)
              |
        Low Resonance
```

## Status

✅ **CONFIRMED** - Phases remained stable even when labels inverted
✅ **STRUCTURAL LAW** - Defines the manifold topology
✅ **WORKING** - Used in Layer 4 decision logic

## The Deep Insight

This is the "Standard Model" of Livnium.

Just as matter has solid/liquid/gas phases, meaning has entailment/contradiction/neutral phases.

These are **energy states** in the geometric universe.
