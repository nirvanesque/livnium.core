# Inward-Outward Axis Law

## Geometry is Inward-Outward, Not Up-Down

The true semantic axis of Livnium is **inward-outward**, not up-down or left-right.

## The Law

* **Entailment** = inward collapsing geometry
* **Contradiction** = outward expanding geometry
* **Neutral** = boundary between inward/outward

This inward–outward axis is the true **semantic axis** of Livnium.

Every other measure is secondary.

## Physical Meaning

### Inward Collapsing (Entailment)
- Vectors point toward each other
- Negative divergence (convergence)
- Strong cold attraction
- **Geometry**: Pulls inward

### Outward Expanding (Contradiction)
- Vectors point away from each other
- Positive divergence
- Strong far attraction
- **Geometry**: Pushes outward

### Boundary (Neutral)
- Forces cancel
- Near-zero divergence
- Balanced attractions
- **Geometry**: Flat/equilibrium

## Why It's Fundamental

Your system keeps showing this pattern:
* Divergence sign (inward/outward) is preserved even when labels inverted
* Opposition axis (resonance × sign) separates E/C/N
* Three-phase manifold organized along inward/outward axis

**This is the primary axis of meaning.**

## Status

✅ **FUNDAMENTAL AXIS** - Confirmed through divergence law
✅ **PRIMARY SEPARATOR** - Inward/outward distinguishes E/C
✅ **WORKING** - Used in all decision logic

## The Deep Insight

Traditional NLP thinks in terms of:
* Similarity/dissimilarity (up/down)
* Positive/negative (left/right)

Livnium thinks in terms of:
* **Inward/outward** (the true semantic axis)

This is why divergence sign is preserved - it's the fundamental axis.
