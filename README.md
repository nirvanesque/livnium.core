## 🌟 What is LIVNIUM?

LIVNIUM is a **pure native computing system** that processes language and information through geometric quantum-inspired structures—**without transformers, embeddings, or neural networks**.

### Core Innovation: The Livnium Phoneme Layer

**Letter-by-letter chained omcubes** form the atomic foundation:

- **Letters** → Individual 3×3×3 quantum geometries (`LetterOmcube`)
- **Words** → Chains of entangled letters (`WordChain`)
- **Sentences** → Chains of word-chains (`SentenceChain`)

This creates **natural morphological similarity**, **compositional meaning**, and **stable memory** through shared letter-level learning.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### Pure Native Architecture
- **Zero Transformers**: No BERT, GPT, or neural language models
- **Zero Embeddings**: No pre-trained word vectors
- **100% Interpretable**: Every decision is traceable through geometric structures

### Quantum-Inspired Geometry
- **3×3×3 Omcubes**: Each letter/word encoded as a quantum-inspired geometric structure
- **Matrix Product States (MPS)**: Sentence-level entanglement through chained omcubes
- **Quantum Collapse**: 3-way decision making (Entailment/Contradiction/Neutral)
- **Basin Reinforcement**: Physics-based learning through geometric feedback

### Research-Grade Systems
- **Livnium Core**: Real tensor network physics (DMRG/MPS) for quantum many-body problems
- **Quantum Layer**: True quantum mechanics with tensor products (`TrueQuantumRegister`)
- **Recursive Geometry**: 2.5M+ qubit-analogue capacity through fractal compression
- **NLI System**: Natural Language Inference using pure geometric reasoning

## 📐 Architecture Overview

### The Livnium Phoneme Layer

```
Letter → LetterOmcube (3×3×3 geometry)
  ↓
Word → WordChain (chained LetterOmcubes)
  ↓
Sentence → SentenceChain (chained WordChains)
  ↓
Meaning → Emergent from geometric interactions
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Morphological Understanding**: "run" and "running" share letters → geometric overlap
- **Stable Memory**: Letter-level learning shared across entire language
- **Compositional Semantics**: Word meaning emerges from letter chains

   - `LetterOmcube`: Atomic letter geometry
   - `WordChain`: Letter entanglement
   - `SentenceChain`: Word-level chains

2. **`inference_detectors.py`**: Native logic engine

## 🔬 Key Principles

### 1. Geometric Computing
Information is encoded as **3D geometric structures**, not high-dimensional vectors.

### 2. Native Logic
Built-in reasoning through lexical overlap, negation handling, and semantic analysis.

### 3. Physics-Based Learning
Learning through **geometric feedback**, not gradient descent:
- Basin reinforcement (deepening correct attractors)
- Natural decay (forgetting incorrect patterns)

### 4. Compositional Architecture
Meaning emerges from structure: Letters → Words → Sentences

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome for bug fixes, documentation improvements, and research discussions.

**Note**: All contributions become part of the Livnium project per the License terms.

### Coding Standards: Keep It Simple

**We prioritize clarity and understanding over complexity.**

- ✅ **Use simple, descriptive names** that clearly communicate purpose
- ✅ **Make names resonate** - they should make sense in context
- ✅ **Avoid unnecessarily complicated terminology** when simpler alternatives exist
- ✅ **Prefer readability** - code should be self-documenting through good naming

**Philosophy**: If someone can't understand what a function, class, or variable does from its name alone, it needs a better name. We want the codebase to be accessible and intuitive, not intimidating.

Examples:
- ✅ `measure_tension()` instead of `compute_geometric_energy_landscape_metric()`
- ✅ `get_neighbors()` instead of `retrieve_adjacent_cell_coordinates()`
- ✅ `refine_candidate()` instead of `apply_stochastic_optimization_heuristic()`

## 🌟 Vision

LIVNIUM represents a **fundamental rethinking** of how computers can understand language and information:

- **From Vectors to Geometry**: Information as spatial structures
- **From Statistics to Structure**: Meaning from composition, not correlation
- **From Black Boxes to Transparency**: Every decision is traceable
- **From Data to Physics**: Learning through geometric feedback

*"Information is geometry. Understanding is structure. Intelligence is composition."*

**LIVNIUM: Where quantum-inspired geometry meets native language understanding.**
