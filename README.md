# LIVNIUM

**Law-Governed Geometric Computing Platform**

LIVNIUM is a system that replaces "searching for answers" with "removing impossible futures until only one path can fall."

## What is LIVNIUM?

LIVNIUM is a geometric computing platform built on immutable laws. Instead of training neural networks to approximate functions, LIVNIUM uses geometric constraints and physics-based collapse to eliminate impossible states until only valid solutions remain.

### Core Philosophy

- **Kernel (LUGK)**: Immutable laws and invariants — pure mathematics, no dependencies
- **Engine (LUGE)**: Runtime dynamics that enforce the laws
- **Domains**: Plugins that encode domain-specific problems into geometric space

The kernel is locked — it represents the constitutional laws of the system. The engine implements those laws. Domains use the laws but cannot modify them.

## Quick Start

```python
import torch
from livnium.engine.collapse.engine import CollapseEngine
from livnium.domains.toy.encoder import ToyEncoder
from livnium.domains.toy.head import ToyHead

# Create components
encoder = ToyEncoder(dim=64)
collapse_engine = CollapseEngine(dim=64, num_layers=3)
head = ToyHead(dim=64, num_classes=3)

# Encode input
x_a = torch.randn(2)
x_b = torch.randn(2)
h0, v_a, v_b = encoder.build_initial_state(x_a, x_b)

# Collapse using kernel physics
h_final, trace = collapse_engine.collapse(h0)

# Get output
logits = head(h_final, v_a, v_b)
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

See `livnium/QUICKSTART.md` for detailed setup and examples.

## Available Domains

- **Toy** - Minimal test domain for kernel+engine integration
- **SNLI** - Stanford Natural Language Inference
- **Market** - Financial time series regime classification
- **Ramsey** - Graph coloring constraint satisfaction

## Key Features

- **Law-preserving**: Kernel laws are immutable and verified
- **Compositional**: Domains plug in without modifying core
- **Geometric**: Problems encoded as geometric constraints
- **Physics-based**: Uses alignment, divergence, and tension laws

## License

LIVNIUM is licensed under **LIVNIUM License v1.0** — a law-preserving research license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

**Key points:**
- ✅ Free for research and education
- ✅ Open research derivatives allowed
- ❌ Commercial use requires separate license
- 🔒 Kernel integrity must be preserved

## Research

LIVNIUM has been applied to:
- Natural language inference (SNLI)
- Financial market regime detection
- Constraint satisfaction (Ramsey numbers)
- Rule 30 chaos analysis (see `archives-public/rule30/`)

## Contributing

LIVNIUM follows strict architectural boundaries:
- Kernel is locked — changes require justification
- Engine implements kernel laws
- Domains use but don't modify laws

See `livnium/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the complete design philosophy.
