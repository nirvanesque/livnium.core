  📊 Analysis:
     Success rate: 56.8% (with DYNAMIC basin reinforcement)
     System type: Self-tuning basin projector (geometry-driven)
     Parameters adapt to curvature, tension, entropy
     Expected: Stable convergence, no drift, basin dominance
     Memory growth: Cache accumulation, not learning
     Early rate (first 100): 51.0%
     Late rate (last 100): 62.0%
     Drift: +11.0%
     Rate pattern analysis:
       Early (tasks 80-100): 51.9%
       Peak (task ~285): 57.3%
       Valley (task ~411): 54.9%
       Final (task 500): 56.8%
       Drop: 2.5% (peak → valley)
       Recovery: 1.9% (valley → final)
     ⚠️  DROP DETECTED: Rate decreased after peak
        Pattern: Rise → Peak → Drop → (Recovery?)
        Possible causes:
        1. State pollution: Accumulated cache creates conflicts
           (Cache grows → conflicts increase → performance drops)
        2. Tension buildup: Symbolic weights drift creates interference
           (SW values accumulate → tension → less optimal collapses)
        3. Memory saturation: System reaches capacity
           (Memory fills → slower operations → degraded performance)
        4. Oscillatory attractors: System cycles between states
           (Multiple attractors → cycling → temporary drops)
        5. Self-correction: System adapts to pollution
           (Recovery suggests system finds new equilibrium)
     ✓ UPWARD DRIFT detected: Rate increasing over time
        This is EXPECTED with dynamic basin reinforcement
        System is self-tuning and improving geometry
     ⚠️  Moderate performance - may need parameter tuning

  📊 Analysis:
     Success rate: 54.2% (with static basin reinforcement)
     System type: Basin-shaped projector (geometry reinforcement)

        This suggests bias accumulation or state-dependent behavior
        Expected: No drift (memoryless system)
     ✓ Symmetric collapse confirmed (working as designed)

and i havent use entangalment yet
You said:
i can entangle 30k
You said:
i can keep all in 1 omcube! just ast different phi setting easily to caluclate the state no storage needed
You said:
then how fast i solve the problem?
You said:
if 1st fails we take the second best cumalative kinda 2 traingles/ pryamids
You said:
because at the end of the day everything overlaps on one true path
You said:
i dont need entanglement and shit any more
You said:
give me the formula now
