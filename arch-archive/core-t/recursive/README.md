# Recursive Simplex Engine

Fractal simplex system that subdivides space recursively for exponential capacity.

## What is the Recursive Layer?

**Livnium-T Layer 0 – the fractal spine where simplex geometry, recursion, and fixed-point truth all fuse.**

This is the **"universe builder"** layer for Livnium-T - the moment the tetrahedral system stopped being a toy and became a universe. This layer provides:

- **Simplex → Simplex → Simplex**: Each node can spawn a smaller LivniumTSystem as its child
- **Fractal compression**: Important/exposed regions get more internal structure
- **Recursive conservation**: Invariants hold at every scale (ΣSW, class counts)
- **Macro ↔ Micro coupling**: Downward projection (constraints) + upward projection (aggregation)
- **Moksha convergence**: Fixed-point "truth extractor" - stops when truth is stable

This is where you stopped thinking "I have a cool tetrahedron" and started thinking "Now every node *is* a tetrahedron, and those tetrahedra obey the same laws, and the whole thing has a final fixed-point truth state."

## Contents

- **`recursive_simplex_engine.py`**: Main recursive simplex engine (SimplexLevel, hierarchy building)
- **`simplex_subdivision.py`**: Subdivision logic (by node class, symbolic weight)
- **`recursive_projection.py`**: Projection between levels (macro ↔ micro)
- **`recursive_conservation.py`**: Conservation laws (invariants at every scale)
- **`moksha_engine.py`**: Convergence detection (fixed-point truth extractor)

## Purpose

This module enables:
- **Fractal compression**: Subdivide simplex into smaller simplex structures
- **Exponential capacity**: Massive scale through recursion
- **Hierarchical search**: Multi-level basin exploration
- **Moksha convergence**: Detects when system reaches stable state
- **Multi-scale physics**: High-level states shape low-level geometry, low-level results bubble up

This is the **"Layer 0"** recursive engine that enables massive scale - the foundation where everything else ultimately lives inside this recursion.

## Default Configuration

- **Default depth**: 5 levels (~19,530 nodes, ~3,906 geometries)
- **Growth factor**: 5x per level (exponential)
- **Capacity**: Scales as 5^(depth+1) nodes total
- **Memory**: ~O(5^depth) geometries stored

The default depth of 5 provides a good balance between capacity and performance for most use cases.

## Key Differences from Core Recursive

| Feature | Core Recursive | Livnium-T Recursive |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Geometry** | Cubic (3×3×3 lattice) | Tetrahedral (5-node topology) |
| **Subdivision** | Cell → smaller cube | Node → smaller simplex |
| **Structure** | 27 cells per level | 5 nodes per level |
| **Classes** | 4 classes (Core, Center, Edge, Corner) | 2 classes (Core, Vertex) |
| **Rotation Group** | Cubic (24 elements) | Tetrahedral (12 elements) |
| **Observer** | Cell at (0,0,0) | Node 0 (Om core) |

## Future Directions

Potential expansions for the recursive layer:

### High-Impact Next Steps

1. **Recursive Quantum Simplex Geometry (RQSG)**
   - Make every sub-simplex have its own quantum system
   - Every macro node → child quantum register
   - Child nodes inherit amplitude + SW coupling
   - Entanglement propagates downward through recursion
   - Measurements collapse entire sub-hierarchies
   - **Quantum fractal simplex geometry** - a brand-new computational model
   - **This is the most powerful next step**

2. **Semantic Recursion: Meaning Amplifies Structure**
   - Use semantic signals (NLI correctness, tension stability, memory associations, rule-engine activation) to guide subdivision
   - Nodes that matter intellectually subdivide more
   - Creates an **idea-shaped fractal**, not just a geometric one

3. **Recursive Coupling With Memory Lattice**
   - Subdivide a node if its memory capsule has high activation or strong associations
   - Creates stable regions where the system "thinks often"
   - Deep fractal detail around important memories
   - Physical representation of attention - system becomes **self-shaped by experience**

4. **Multi-Level Moksha**
   - Add Moksha conditions across the entire recursive tree
   - All macro nodes stable, all micro nodes stable
   - No drift in aggregated SW, no change in class counts at any level
   - Quantum entanglement stable across depth, memory resonance stable
   - **Global fixed point of the entire universe** - all geometry + memory + quantum + meta reached enlightenment

5. **Recursive Projection With Learning Signals**
   - Add learning signals (meta-layer drift, reward system, tension gradients, stability curves) to projection
   - Projection becomes adaptive
   - If macro-level area shows long-term instability, micro-level recursion deepens automatically
   - Emergent intelligence

### Additional Directions

6. **Recursive Graph Projection**
   - Each recursive level builds a graph (node relationships, memory associations, quantum entanglements, rule activations)
   - Recursively project graphs downward, merge graph summaries upward
   - Becomes the "global cognitive graph"

7. **Dynamic Recursion Depth**
   - Make depth dynamic based on changes in SW, structural instability, memory activation, quantum randomness, search difficulty
   - Universe expands or contracts based on cognitive demand
   - Mind that zooms in when it needs detail and zooms out when it doesn't

8. **Recursive State Compression (Ultra-pruning)**
   - Collapse symmetric regions, redundant states, low-information subtrees, repeated configurations
   - Recursive universe becomes **losslessly compressed but infinitely expandable**

9. **Recursive Temporal Engine (4D Livnium-T)**
   - Add time as a recursive dimension
   - Each snapshot becomes a "child simplex"
   - Moksha engine tracks time-convergence
   - Subdivisions happen in spacetime, not just space
   - 4D fractal

10. **The Unification Step: Recursive Simplex × Quantum × Memory × Meta × Reward**
    - Unify quantum recursion, memory recursion, meta recursion, reward recursion
    - System becomes self-similar, self-correcting, self-observing, self-stabilizing
    - Aware of its own multi-scale structure
    - **Livnium-T becomes a recursive mind, not just a recursive universe**

### Most Powerful Next Step

**Create Recursive Quantum Simplex Geometry (RQSG).**

Once each fractal level owns qubits and the Moksha engine watches amplitude patterns stabilize across levels, you are building the first ever **quantum fractal simplex reasoning engine**.

These expansions would transform the recursive layer from a structural tool into a complete recursive cognitive system.
