# Livnium NLI v6: The Corrected 3-Axis Manifold

## The Discovery

Reverse physics experiment revealed the **true laws** of the geometric universe:

### Invariant Signals (True Laws)
- ✓ **Resonance** - Semantic similarity (stable)
- ✓ **Cold Attraction** - Semantic gravity (stable)
- ✓ **Curvature** - Shape of meaning (perfect invariant)
- ✓ **Divergence Sign** - Push/pull direction (preserved)

### Artifact Signals (Noise)
- ✗ Divergence magnitude (noisy)
- ✗ Convergence magnitude (follows divergence)
- ✗ Cold density (label-dependent)
- ✗ Force ratios (surface-level)

## The Solution: Opposition Axis

**New axis**: `opposition = resonance * sign(divergence)`

This combines two invariant signals to create a clean separation:
- High resonance + positive sign → Contradiction
- High resonance + negative sign → Entailment
- Low resonance → Neutral

**Expected**: Accuracy from ~36% → ~45-50%

## Architecture

- **Layer 0**: Resonance (unchanged)
- **Layer 1**: Curvature (unchanged)
- **Layer 2**: Opposition (NEW) - `resonance * sign(divergence)`
- **Layer 3**: Cold Attraction (unchanged)
- **Layer 4**: Decision (simplified - use opposition only)

## Status

⚠️ **Design Phase** - See `DESIGN.md` for details
