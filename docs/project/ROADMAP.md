# LIVNIUM Quantum-Inspired Systems Roadmap

## Current Status

✅ **Phase 1: Reorganization Complete**
- Three systems properly separated into `quantum/islands/`, `quantum/hierarchical/`, `quantum/livnium_core/`
- All imports fixed and verified
- Documentation created with proper disclaimers
- Clean project structure established

## Future Development

### Short Term (Next 3 months)

1. **Islands System Enhancements**
   - Improve feature integration
   - Add more classification algorithms
   - Optimize geometric simulator performance

2. **Hierarchical System Improvements**
   - Expand geometry levels if needed
   - Add more simulators
   - Improve algorithm implementations

3. **Livnium Core Extensions**
   - Add 2D/3D TFIM support
   - Implement more tensor network methods
   - Add visualization tools

### Medium Term (3-6 months)

1. **New Quantum-Inspired Systems**
   - `livnium_vector/` - Vector-based quantum-inspired system
   - `livnium_field/` - Field-based quantum-inspired system
   - `livnium_wave/` - Wave-based quantum-inspired system

2. **Integration Tools**
   - Unified API for all systems
   - Cross-system utilities
   - Performance benchmarking suite

3. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive API documentation
   - Tutorial series
   - Research papers

### Long Term (6+ months)

1. **Research Applications**
   - Semantic reasoning systems
   - Pattern recognition
   - Complex system analysis

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - GPU acceleration
   - Distributed computing
   - Memory optimization

3. **Community**
   - Open source release
   - Contributor guidelines
   - Example projects

## Principles

- **Clear separation**: Each system maintains its own namespace
- **No quantum confusion**: All documentation clearly states "NOT a quantum computer"
- **Professional structure**: Follows best practices for research software
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new quantum-inspired systems
